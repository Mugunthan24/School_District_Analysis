# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing student funding and student standardized test scores to finds trends in school performance using Python and Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of the School District Analysis:
Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for a school district needs assistance analyzing student funding and students standardized test scores. We are tasked to aggreagate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will aid the school board and superintendant regarding the school budget and priorities. Upon completing the orginal analysis, it has come to the schoolboards attention that the grades in the csv file for ninth grade students at Thomas High School appears to have been altered. Although, the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and Maria has requested that the grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School be replaced with "NaNs," while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the math and reading scores have been replaced, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results
The subsequent paragraphs will compare and contrast the initial results of the analyis against the new results which accounting for the academic dishonesty associated with ninth graders math and reading grades at Thomas High School.
